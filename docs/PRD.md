# Jarvis - AI-Powered ZSH Plugin PRD

## Overview
Jarvis is an intelligent ZSH plugin that enhances command-line interactions through AI-powered pre-processing and post-processing of commands.

## Core Features

### 1. Pre-Command Processing
- **Trigger**: Commands prefixed with '@jarvis' (configurable via settings)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert natural language to shell commands
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and parse command intents
- **User Confirmation**: Present transformed commands for user approval

### 2. Post-Command Processing
- **Command Execution Data Collection**:
  - Exit status codes
  - Standard error (stderr)
  - Standard output (stdout)

- **Interactive Query System**:
  - '@AI why' - Explain command failures
  - '@AI what' - Summarize command results
  - '@AI ?' - General command context

### 3. MCP Integration
- Leverage MCP for enhanced AI capabilities
- Support for various AI models and services
- Extensible architecture for future AI features
