# Jarvis - AI-Powered Shell Assistant PRD

## Overview
Jarvis is an intelligent, AI-powered shell assistant that enhances command-line interactions through natural language understanding, command suggestion, and post-execution analysis. Jarvis is designed to work with any POSIX-compatible shell (Zsh, Bash, etc.) by simply sourcing a script—no plugin system or shell hooks required.

## Core Features

### 1. Natural Language Command Processing
- **Trigger**: Commands prefixed with `@jarvis` (configurable)
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Converts user intent into shell commands
- **Command Refinement**: Suggests improvements and corrections
- **User Confirmation**: Presents refined commands for approval

### 2. Post-Command Analysis
- **Execution Data Collection**:
  - Exit status codes
  - Combined output (stdout/stderr)
- **AI-Powered Explanations**:
  - `@jarvis why` — Explain command failures
  - `@jarvis ?` — Summarize or clarify command results
- **Error Troubleshooting**: Provides actionable suggestions for fixing failed commands

## Technical Requirements

### Shell Integration
- Works by sourcing `jarvis.plugin.zsh` in any shell session (Zsh, Bash, etc.)
- No plugin hooks or shell-specific APIs required
- Minimal impact on shell performance

### AI Processing
- Requires Python 3 and the `llm` package (`pip install llm`)
- Asynchronous and robust command processing
- Configurable AI model selection

### Security
- No sensitive data transmission outside the local machine unless configured
- Local processing preferred when possible
- Secure handling of API keys and credentials

## Success Metrics
- High command interpretation accuracy
- Fast response times for common queries
- Positive user feedback and adoption
- Reduction in command-line errors and friction

## Future Enhancements
- Smarter command pattern recognition
- Learning from user corrections and feedback
- Multi-model and multi-backend AI support
- Advanced session management and history features
- Broader shell and platform compatibility

# TBD

## 3. MCP and Python Integration
- **MCP Integration**: Leverage MCP for advanced AI capabilities
- **Python/llm Backend**: Uses Python and the `llm` package for command processing and analysis
- **Extensible**: Designed for easy extension with new AI models and features
